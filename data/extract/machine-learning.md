#### Data Structures

Python provides several built-in data structures for organizing and storing data. These structures include lists, which are ordered and mutable collections; tuples, which are ordered and immutable collections; dictionaries, which store data in key-value pairs; and sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. Each data structure offers different performance characteristics and is suitable for various tasks depending on the specific requirements of the program.

#### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy. This involves selecting, transforming, and creating new features from existing data. The goal is to extract more information from the data and make it easier for machine learning algorithms to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.

## Machine Learning

#### Exceptions

Exceptions in Python are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution. They occur when the interpreter encounters an error during runtime, such as trying to divide by zero or accessing an index that's out of bounds in a list. When an exception occurs, Python creates an exception object. If the exception isn't handled, the program will terminate and display an error message. However, you can use `try` and `except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions, allowing your program to continue running even when errors occur.

- `@video` [Learn Python EXCEPTION HANDLING in 5 minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_NXT2-QIlE)

#### Feature Selection

Feature selection is the process of choosing a subset of the most relevant features from your original dataset. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by removing irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features. This can lead to simpler models, improved model performance (e.g., accuracy, speed), and better understanding of the underlying data.

- `@article` [What is Feature Selection? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/feature-selection)

#### Variables and Data Types

Variables are named storage locations in a computer's memory used to hold data. Data types classify the kind of value a variable can hold, such as numbers (integers, decimals), text (strings), or boolean values (true/false). Understanding variables and data types is fundamental to writing any program, as it dictates how data is stored, manipulated, and used within the code.

- `@video` [Python Variables and Data Types](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRhN-sfWgCU1z_Qhakc1AGOn)

#### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning, which is often referred as data cleansing or data scrubbing, is one of the most important and initial steps in the data analysis process. As a data analyst, the bulk of your work often revolves around understanding, cleaning, and standardizing raw data before analysis. Data cleaning involves identifying, correcting or removing any errors or inconsistencies in datasets in order to improve their quality. The process is crucial because it directly determines the accuracy of the insights you generate - garbage in, garbage out. Even the most sophisticated models and visualizations would not be of much use if they're based on dirty data. Therefore, mastering data cleaning techniques is essential for any data analyst.

- `@article` [Data cleaning](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-cleaning)

#### Functions, Builtin Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They take inputs, process them, and return an output. Python provides many built-in functions like `print()` for displaying output, `len()` for finding the length of a sequence, and `type()` for determining the data type of a variable. These built-in functions are readily available for use, while you can also define your own custom functions, also known as user-defined functions (UDFs), to encapsulate specific logic and improve code organization.

- `@video` [Functions in Python | Python for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvzjaqMBEso)

#### Conditionals

Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. The most common conditional statements are `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else`. An `if` statement checks a condition, and if it's true, the code block under it runs. `elif` allows you to check additional conditions if the initial `if` condition is false. Finally, `else` provides a block of code to execute if none of the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are true. These statements enable programs to make decisions and respond differently to various inputs or situations.

#### Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction. Feature selection selects a subset of the original features, while feature extraction transforms the data into a lower-dimensional space. The goal is to simplify the data without losing important information, making it easier to analyze and model.

### Introduction

Machine learning is about creating computer programs that can learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, these programs improve their performance on a specific task as they are exposed to more data. This learning process allows them to make predictions or decisions without being directly told how to do so.

- `@article` [What is Machine Learning?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning)
- `@video` [What is Machine Learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gGnTQTYNaE)

#### ML Engineer vs AI Engineer

An ML Engineer primarily concentrates on building, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models in production environments. An AI Engineer, on the other hand, typically has a broader scope, encompassing the design and development of entire AI systems, which may include components beyond just machine learning, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

- `@video` [AI vs Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RixMPF4xis)

#### Loops

Loops in Python are a way to repeat a block of code multiple times. They allow you to execute a set of instructions over and over, either a specific number of times or until a certain condition is met. Python has two main types of loops: `for` loops, which are typically used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or string), and `while` loops, which continue executing as long as a given condition remains true.

- `@article` [Loops](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops)
- `@article` [Python While Loops & For Loops | Python tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23vCap6iYSs)

#### Feature Scaling & Normalization

Feature scaling is a preprocessing technique in machine learning that transforms numerical features to a common scale, ensuring they contribute equally to the model by preventing features with larger ranges from dominating, which is particularly important for algorithms sensitive to feature scales like gradient descent-based methods. Key methods include Standardization (transforming data to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, often better for outliers), and Normalization (scaling data to a fixed range, often 0 to 1).

- `@article` [Normalization vs. Standardization: How to Know the Difference](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/normalization-vs-standardization)
- `@video` [Standardization vs Normalization Clearly Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxEqtjLC0aM)

#### Skills and Responsibilities

Machine learning roles require a blend of technical expertise and practical abilities. These roles involve designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models to solve real-world problems. Key skills include proficiency in programming languages like Python, a strong understanding of statistical concepts, and experience with machine learning frameworks. Responsibilities often encompass data collection and preprocessing, model selection and training, performance evaluation, and continuous model improvement.

#### What is an ML Engineer?

An ML Engineer focuses on building, deploying, and maintaining machine learning systems in production. They bridge the gap between data science and software engineering, taking models developed by data scientists and making them scalable, reliable, and efficient for real-world applications. This involves tasks like data pipeline construction, model deployment, performance monitoring, and infrastructure management.

- `@article` [What Is a Machine Learning Engineer? (+ How to Get Started)](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-machine-learning-engineer)

#### Derivatives, Partial Derivatives

A derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. Imagine a curve on a graph; the derivative at a specific point tells you the slope of the line tangent to that curve at that point. When dealing with functions of multiple variables, we use partial derivatives. A partial derivative measures how a function changes with respect to one specific variable, while holding all other variables constant.

- `@article` [Derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative)
- `@video` [What is a Derivative? Deriving the Power Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3iEEDxrhyE)

#### Matrix & Matrix Operations

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. Matrix operations are the rules and procedures for manipulating these matrices. These operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, transposition (flipping rows and columns), and finding the inverse of a matrix, each with specific rules about the dimensions of the matrices involved.

- `@article` [Matrix (mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics))
- `@video` [Linear Algebra - Matrix Operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p48uw2vFWQs)

#### Determinants, inverse of Matrix

A determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix. The inverse of a matrix, denoted as A⁻¹, is another matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix A, results in the identity matrix. The inverse exists only for square matrices with a non-zero determinant, making the matrix invertible.

#### Basic concepts

Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides the foundation for understanding patterns and making inferences from data, which is crucial for machine learning algorithms. Here are 10 basic statistical concepts:

*   **Mean:** The average value of a dataset, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.
*   **Median:** The middle value in a sorted dataset.
*   **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
*   **Standard Deviation:** A measure of the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean.
*   **Variance:** The square of the standard deviation, representing the average squared difference from the mean.
*   **Probability:** The likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
*   **Distributions:** A function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur (e.g., normal distribution, uniform distribution).
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** A method for testing a claim or hypothesis about a population based on a sample of data.
*   **Correlation:** A statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables are related.
*   **Regression:** A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

#### Random Variances, PDFs

A random variable is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. It can be discrete (taking on a finite or countably infinite number of values) or continuous (taking on any value within a given range).

The probability density function (PDF) describes the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on a given value. It's important to note that the value of the PDF at any given point is not a probability itself, but rather the area under the PDF curve over a given interval represents the probability of the random variable falling within that interval.

- `@video` [Sample Variance in Random Population Sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNnUVHfX5yQ)

#### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from a labeled dataset. This means that each data point in the dataset is paired with a corresponding correct output, or "label." The algorithm's goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs, so that when given new, unseen inputs, it can predict the correct output based on the patterns it learned from the labeled data.

- `@video` [Supervised Machine Learning Explained For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu3POlNoLdc)

#### Self-supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from unlabeled data by creating its own supervisory signals. This is achieved by masking parts of the input data and training the model to predict the masked portions based on the remaining data. In essence, the data itself provides the labels, allowing the model to learn useful representations without requiring explicit human annotation.

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple algorithm used for classifying data points based on their proximity to other data points. Given a new, unclassified data point, KNN identifies the 'K' closest data points (neighbors) from the training dataset. The class that appears most frequently among these 'K' neighbors is then assigned as the class of the new data point.

- `@video` [How to Build Your First KNN Python Model in scikit-learn (K Nearest Neighbors)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz73vXn5afE)

#### Decision Trees, Random Forest

Decision Trees are a way to make predictions by learning decision rules from data features. Imagine a flowchart where each internal node represents a test on an attribute (like "Is the color red?"), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (like "apple" or "banana"). Random Forests improve upon this by creating multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data and features, then combining their predictions to get a more accurate and robust result.

#### Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple method used to find the best straight line that describes the relationship between a dependent variable (the one you're trying to predict) and one or more independent variables (the ones you're using to make the prediction). It works by finding the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the values predicted by the line. This line can then be used to predict the dependent variable for new values of the independent variables.

- `@video` [Hands-On Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukZn2RJb7TU)

#### Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used when the relationship between the input features and the output variable is non-linear. Instead of fitting a straight line, it fits a polynomial equation to the data. This allows the model to capture curves and more complex relationships, potentially leading to better predictions when a linear model is insufficient. The degree of the polynomial determines the complexity of the curve that can be fitted.

- `@article` [Build a Polynomial Regression Model in Python using Scikit-Learn](https://medium.com/@renadalhendy/build-a-polynomial-regression-model-in-python-using-scikit-learn-1b5fd31beb02)

#### Exclusive

Exclusive clustering, also known as hard clustering, is a type of clustering where each data point can only belong to one cluster. This means there's no overlap between clusters; a data point is definitively assigned to a single group. The goal is to partition the data into distinct, non-overlapping clusters based on similarity. For example, K-Means is an exclusive clustering algorithm. It aims to partition n data points into k clusters in which each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.

- `@article` [Unsupervised Clustering: A Guide](https://builtin.com/articles/unsupervised-clustering)

#### Probabilistic

Probabilistic clustering assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of probability distributions. Instead of assigning each data point to a single cluster, it provides the probability of a data point belonging to each cluster. A common example is the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), where it's assumed that the data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Scikit-learn provides an implementation of GMM that can be used for probabilistic clustering.

- `@article` [Gaussian Mixture Model Explained](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#mixture)

#### Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while preserving the most important information. It transforms the original variables into a new set of variables called principal components, which are ordered by the amount of variance they explain. The first principal component captures the most variance, the second captures the second most, and so on. By selecting a smaller number of these principal components, you can reduce the dimensionality of the data without losing too much information.

#### Deep-Q Networks

Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks. Instead of using a traditional Q-table to store Q-values (which represent the expected reward for taking a specific action in a specific state), DQNs use a neural network to approximate the Q-function. This allows DQNs to handle environments with large or continuous state spaces where a Q-table would be impractical. The neural network takes the state as input and outputs the Q-values for each possible action, enabling the agent to learn optimal policies through trial and error.

- `@video` [Deep Q-Learning/Deep Q-Network (DQN) Explained | Python Pytorch Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrWGTCGzlA)

#### Q-Learning

Q-Learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to find the best action to take given the current state. It works by learning a "Q-function," which estimates the expected cumulative reward for taking a specific action in a particular state and following the optimal policy thereafter. This Q-function is iteratively updated based on the agent's experiences, allowing it to learn the optimal policy without needing a model of the environment.

- `@video` [What is Q-Learning (back to basics)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOBm4aYEYR4)

#### Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It displays the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions, allowing for a detailed analysis of the model's accuracy and types of errors it makes. This breakdown helps in understanding where the model excels and where it struggles, providing insights beyond simple accuracy scores.

#### Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptrons

A perceptron is a fundamental building block of neural networks, acting as a single-layer linear classifier. It takes several inputs, multiplies each by a weight, sums them up, and then applies an activation function to produce an output. Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) extend this concept by stacking multiple layers of perceptrons, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, allowing for the modeling of more complex, non-linear relationships in data.

- `@video` [The Perceptron Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1G7PXZMnSc)

#### Activation Functions

Activation functions in neural networks determine the output of a node given an input or set of inputs. They introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in data. Without activation functions, a neural network would simply be a linear regression model, severely limiting its ability to model intricate data.

- `@video` [Activation Functions In Neural Networks Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fu273ovPBmQ)

#### Loss Functions

Loss functions measure how well the network's predictions match the actual values. They quantify the difference between the predicted output and the true output for a given input. The goal during training is to minimize this loss, guiding the network to adjust its internal parameters (weights and biases) to make more accurate predictions. Different loss functions are suitable for different types of problems, such as regression or classification.

#### K-Fold Cross Validation

K-Fold Cross Validation is a technique used to assess how well a machine learning model will generalize to an independent dataset. It works by dividing the available data into _k_ equally sized folds or subsets. The model is then trained _k_ times, each time using _k-1_ folds as the training set and the remaining fold as the validation set. The performance metrics from each of the _k_ iterations are then averaged to provide an overall estimate of the model's performance.

- `@video` [Complete Guide to Cross Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8s9KuNo5SA&t=925s)

#### Convolution

Convolution is a mathematical operation that involves sliding a filter (also known as a kernel) over an input image or feature map. At each location, the filter performs element-wise multiplication with the corresponding part of the input, and then sums the results. This sum becomes a single value in the output feature map. By sliding the filter across the entire input, the convolution operation extracts features and patterns present in the image, such as edges, textures, or shapes.

- `@article` [Convolutional Neural Networks cheatsheet](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-convolutional-neural-networks)
- `@video` [But what is a convolution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA)

#### Strides

In convolutional neural networks, a stride determines how many pixels the filter (or kernel) shifts horizontally and vertically during the convolution operation. A stride of 1 means the filter moves one pixel at a time, resulting in a more detailed feature map. A larger stride, like 2 or 3, causes the filter to jump over pixels, producing a smaller feature map and reducing computational cost, but potentially missing finer details in the input image.

- `@article` [Padding and Stride](https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-neural-networks/padding-and-strides.html)
- `@video` [Convolution padding and stride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDAPkZ53zKk)

#### Image & Video Recognition

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network particularly effective at processing images and videos. In image recognition, CNNs can identify objects, scenes, and faces by learning spatial hierarchies of features from pixel data. For video recognition, CNNs analyze sequences of frames to understand actions, events, and even predict future occurrences. This is achieved by extracting relevant spatial and temporal features, enabling applications like video surveillance, autonomous driving, and content analysis.

#### Recommendation Systems

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), typically used for image processing, can also enhance recommendation systems. They do this by extracting features from user-item interaction data, like purchase history or ratings. For example, a CNN can analyze a matrix representing user preferences for different movie genres to identify patterns. These patterns help predict what movies a user might enjoy, even if they haven't explicitly rated them. By learning these complex relationships, CNNs can provide more personalized and accurate recommendations.

#### Self-Attention

Self-attention is a mechanism that allows a model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing it. Instead of treating each element in the sequence independently, self-attention calculates a weighted sum of all elements, where the weights are determined by the relationships between the elements themselves. This enables the model to capture dependencies and contextual information within the input sequence, regardless of their distance from each other.

- `@article` [What is self-attention?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/self-attention)
- `@video` [Why is Self Attention called "Self"? | Self Attention Vs Luong Attention in Depth Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ZVA0TuDRg)

#### Stemming

Stemming is a text normalization technique in natural language processing that reduces words to their root or base form, known as the stem. This is achieved by removing suffixes (like "-ing", "-ed", "-s") from words. The goal is to treat words with similar meanings as the same, even if they have slightly different forms, which helps to simplify text analysis and improve the efficiency of certain NLP tasks.

- `@article` [What are stemming and lemmatization?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/stemming-lemmatization)

#### Embeddings

Embeddings are a way to represent words, phrases, or even entire documents as numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. The goal is to capture the semantic meaning of the text, so that words with similar meanings are located close to each other in the vector space. This allows machine learning models to understand relationships between words and perform tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation more effectively.

- `@article` [A Guide on Word Embeddings in NLP](https://www.turing.com/kb/guide-on-word-embeddings-in-nlp)

#### Attention Models

Attention models in natural language processing allow a neural network to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when producing an output. Instead of relying on a fixed-length vector representation of the entire input, these models learn to assign weights to different input elements, indicating their relevance to the current output. This mechanism enables the model to selectively attend to the most important information, improving performance in tasks like machine translation and text summarization.

- `@article` [What is an attention mechanism?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/attention-mechanism)

#### Data Loading

Data loading in Scikit-learn refers to the process of importing datasets into a format that can be used for machine learning tasks. This involves reading data from various sources, such as CSV files, databases, or even directly from NumPy arrays, and structuring it into a format that Scikit-learn's algorithms can understand, typically NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames. The loaded data is then usually split into features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable) for training and evaluating machine learning models.

#### ElasticNet Regularization

Elastic Net is a regularization technique that combines the penalties of both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization methods. It aims to improve model performance by addressing limitations of each individual method, particularly in situations where there are many correlated features. By using a linear combination of L1 and L2 penalties, Elastic Net can perform feature selection (like Lasso) and handle multicollinearity (like Ridge) simultaneously.

#### Chain rule of derivation

The chain rule is a formula for finding the derivative of a composite function. If you have a function that's made up of one function inside another (like sin(x²) ), the chain rule lets you break down the differentiation process. It states that the derivative of the composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function.

#### Gradient, Jacobian, Hessian

The gradient, Jacobian, and Hessian are fundamental tools from calculus used to analyze and optimize functions, especially in the context of machine learning. The gradient of a scalar-valued function of multiple variables is a vector containing the partial derivatives with respect to each variable, indicating the direction of the steepest ascent. The Jacobian matrix generalizes the gradient to vector-valued functions of multiple variables, containing all the partial derivatives of each output component with respect to each input variable. The Hessian matrix, on the other hand, is the square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, providing information about the local curvature of the function.

- `@video` [Unsupervised Machine Learning Explained For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteYU_QpUxs)

### Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions. These algorithms are broadly categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train a model to map inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns and structures. Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward. More recently, semi-supervised learning, which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data, and self-supervised learning, where the data itself provides the supervision signal, have gained prominence.

- `@article` [5 types of machine learning](https://lumenalta.com/insights/5-types-of-machine-learning)

#### Semi-supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the training data contains both labeled and unlabeled examples. The goal is to leverage the information from the unlabeled data to improve the performance of a model that would otherwise be trained solely on the labeled data. This approach is particularly useful when obtaining labels is expensive or time-consuming, but unlabeled data is readily available.

- `@video` [What is Semi-Supervised Learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Lr6Waw66g)

#### Train - Test Data

When building a machine learning model, we usually split our dataset into two parts: a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to teach the model how to make predictions, while the testing set is used to evaluate how well the model has learned. This helps us understand if the model can generalize to new, unseen data. In scikit-learn, you can easily split your data using the `train_test_split` function from the `model_selection` module. You provide your data and labels to this function, and it returns the split datasets. You can also specify the proportion of data to be used for testing.

- `@video` [Scikit-learn Crash Course - Machine Learning Library for Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B5eIE_1vpU)

#### Data Preparation

Scikit-learn provides tools to get your data ready for machine learning models. This often involves cleaning, transforming, and scaling your data. Cleaning might mean handling missing values using techniques like imputation. Transformation can involve converting categorical features into numerical ones using methods like one-hot encoding. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model by bringing them to a similar range, using techniques like standardization or normalization. These steps help improve the performance and accuracy of your machine learning models.

- `@video` [Scikit-learn Crash Course - Machine Learning Library for Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B5eIE_1vpU&t=188s)

#### Model Selection

Model selection is the process of choosing the best machine learning model from a set of candidate models for a given task. Scikit-learn offers a wide range of models, including linear models (like linear regression and logistic regression), tree-based models (like decision trees and random forests), support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks, enabling you to find the most suitable model for your specific problem.

- `@official` [Unsupervised Learning Models](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/unsupervised_learning.html)

#### Tuning

Scikit-learn provides tools to find the best settings (hyperparameters) for your machine learning models. Instead of manually trying different values, you can use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV. These methods systematically test a range of hyperparameter combinations using cross-validation to evaluate performance. The goal is to identify the hyperparameter set that yields the best model performance on your data, improving accuracy and generalization.

### What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from a labeled dataset. This means that each data point in the dataset is paired with a corresponding correct output, or "label." The algorithm's goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs, so that when given new, unseen inputs, it can predict the correct output based on the patterns it learned from the labeled data.

- `@video` [Supervised Machine Learning Explained For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu3POlNoLdc)

#### Prediction

In scikit-learn, prediction means using a trained machine learning model to estimate an output (or target variable) for new, unseen data. After a model is trained on a dataset, it learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable. To make a prediction, you provide the model with new input features, and it uses the learned relationship to generate a predicted value for the target. This is typically done using the `.predict()` method on a trained model object, which takes the new data as input and returns the model's predictions.

- `@article` [Metrics and scoring: quantifying the quality of predictions](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)
- `@article` [How to Make Predictions with scikit-learn](https://machinelearningmastery.com/make-predictions-scikit-learn/)

### Classification

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to assign data points to predefined categories or classes. Given a set of labeled data (where each data point has a known class), the algorithm learns a mapping function that can predict the class label for new, unseen data. The output is a discrete value representing the predicted class.

- `@course` [Classification - Google Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification)
- `@article` [What is Classification in Machine Learning?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/classification-machine-learning)
- `@article` [Classification in Machine Learning: A Guide for Beginners](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/classification-machine-learning)

### Regression

Regression in supervised learning is a method used to predict a continuous numerical value. It works by finding the relationship between input features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable). The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the target variable's value based on the given input features. For example, predicting house prices based on size and location is a regression problem.

#### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a method used to predict the probability of a categorical outcome. Instead of predicting a continuous value, it predicts whether something belongs to a certain category (like yes/no, true/false, or 0/1). It does this by using a logistic function (also known as a sigmoid function) to squeeze the output of a linear equation between 0 and 1, representing the probability of belonging to that category. The model learns the best coefficients for the linear equation based on the training data.

#### Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. They work by finding an optimal hyperplane that separates data points belonging to different classes with the largest possible margin. This hyperplane acts as a decision boundary, and new data points are classified based on which side of the hyperplane they fall on.

#### Lasso

Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. This penalty is based on the absolute values of the coefficients, effectively shrinking some coefficients towards zero. This shrinkage not only helps prevent overfitting, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data, but also performs feature selection by potentially eliminating less important features from the model.

- `@article` [Lasso | scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html)

- `@video` [Lasso Regression with Scikit-Learn (Beginner Friendly)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmpBt0tenJE)

#### Ridge

Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty to the size of the coefficients. This penalty, known as L2 regularization, shrinks the coefficient values towards zero. By adding this constraint, Ridge Regression aims to reduce the model's complexity and prevent overfitting, especially when dealing with datasets that have high multicollinearity (where predictor variables are highly correlated).

### What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no pre-defined correct answers or target variables provided to guide the learning process. Instead, the algorithm explores the data to discover hidden structures, relationships, and groupings on its own. Common tasks in unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

- `@video` [Unsupervised Machine Learning Explained For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteYU_QpUxs)

#### Gradient Boosting Machines

Gradient Boosting Machines are a type of ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model for classification tasks. The algorithm works iteratively, with each new tree trained to correct the errors made by the previous trees. This is achieved by focusing on the instances that were misclassified in the previous iterations, effectively "boosting" the performance of the model. Popular implementations of gradient boosting include XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and the original GradientBoostingClassifier, each offering variations in regularization, tree growth strategies, and handling of categorical features.

### Clustering

Clustering is a way to automatically group similar data points together. Imagine you have a bunch of scattered objects and you want to organize them into piles based on how alike they are. Clustering algorithms do this by finding patterns in the data, grouping data points that are close to each other in some way, and separating them from data points that are further apart. The algorithm decides which data points belong to which group, without you telling it what the groups should be beforehand.

- `@article` [Clustering | scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)
- `@article` [What is clustering?](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/overview)

### Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction. Feature selection selects a subset of the original features, while feature extraction transforms the data into a lower-dimensional space. The goal is to simplify the data without losing important information, making it easier to analyze and model.

- `@article` [What is Dimensionality Reduction?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/dimensionality-reduction)
- `@video` [Machine Learning - Dimensionality Reduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU_hBML2H1c)

#### Overlapping

Overlapping clustering allows data points to belong to multiple clusters simultaneously. Unlike traditional "hard" clustering where each point is assigned to only one cluster, overlapping clustering acknowledges that data points can exhibit characteristics of several groups. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex datasets where boundaries between clusters are not well-defined. One algorithm that implements overlapping clustering is the _Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)_ algorithm. FCM assigns a membership degree to each data point for each cluster, representing the probability of belonging to that cluster. A data point can have non-zero membership degrees for multiple clusters, indicating its partial membership in each.

- `@article` [Unsupervised Clustering: A Guide](https://builtin.com/articles/unsupervised-clustering)

#### Autoencoders

Autoencoders are a type of neural network used to learn efficient data representations in an unsupervised manner. They work by compressing the input data into a lower-dimensional "code" and then reconstructing the original input from this compressed representation. By forcing the network to learn a compressed version of the data, autoencoders can discover important features and reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to process and analyze.

- `@article` [What Is an Autoencoder? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/autoencoder)

#### Hierarchical

Hierarchical clustering is a method of grouping data points into clusters based on their similarity, building a hierarchy of clusters. It starts by treating each data point as its own cluster and then iteratively merges the closest clusters until only one cluster remains, or a stopping criterion is met. This process creates a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, which visually represents the hierarchy of clusters. Scikit-learn provides an implementation of agglomerative hierarchical clustering through its `AgglomerativeClustering` class, which allows you to specify the linkage criterion (e.g., ward, complete, average) to determine how the distance between clusters is calculated.

- `@article` [What is Hierarchical Clustering?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/hierarchical-clustering)

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward. The agent interacts with the environment, takes actions, and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Through trial and error, the agent learns a policy that maps states to actions, aiming to accumulate the most reward over time.

- `@video` [Reinforcement Learning in 3 Hours | Full Course using Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mut_u40Sqz4)

#### Accuracy

Accuracy measures how often a machine learning model correctly predicts the outcome. It's calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions made. The formula for accuracy is: (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions).

- `@article` [Accuracy | scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html)
- `@article` [Machine Learning Model Accuracy](https://www.giskard.ai/glossary/machine-learning-model-accuracy)

#### Precision

Precision measures how accurate a model's positive predictions are. It tells you, out of all the instances the model predicted as positive, what proportion were actually positive. In simpler terms, it answers the question: "When the model says something is true, how often is it actually true?". The formula for precision is: Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives).

- `@article` [Precision | scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html)

### What is Model Evaluation?

Model evaluation is the process of assessing how well a machine learning model performs on a given dataset. It involves using various metrics and techniques to quantify the model's accuracy, reliability, and generalization ability. This helps determine if the model is suitable for deployment and whether further improvements are needed.

#### Policy Gradient

Policy Gradient methods are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that directly optimizes the policy function, which maps states to actions. Instead of learning a value function (like Q-learning) and then deriving a policy from it, policy gradient methods directly learn the optimal policy by adjusting its parameters to maximize the expected reward. This is typically done by estimating the gradient of the expected reward with respect to the policy parameters and then updating the parameters in the direction of the gradient.

- `@video` [An introduction to Policy Gradient methods - Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P7I-xPq8u8)

#### F1-Score

The F1-score is a way to measure how accurate a model is, considering both precision and recall. Precision tells you how many of the positive predictions made by the model were actually correct. Recall tells you how many of the actual positive cases the model was able to identify. The F1-score balances these two metrics, giving a single score that represents the overall performance of the model. It's calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall:`F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`

- `@article` [F1-score | scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)

#### Recall

Recall measures how well a model identifies all the actual positive cases. It answers the question: "Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly predict as positive?". A high recall means the model is good at minimizing false negatives. The formula for recall is: `Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`.

- `@article` [Recall | scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html)

### Why is it important?

Model evaluation is the process of assessing how well a machine learning model performs on a given dataset. It involves using various metrics and techniques to quantify the model's accuracy, reliability, and generalization ability. This assessment helps determine if the model is suitable for deployment and provides insights into areas where it can be improved.

#### Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-Critic methods in reinforcement learning are a type of algorithm that combines the strengths of both value-based and policy-based approaches. They use two separate models: an "actor" that learns the optimal policy (how to act), and a "critic" that estimates the value function (how good a state or action is). The critic evaluates the actor's actions, providing feedback that helps the actor improve its policy, while the actor uses this feedback to refine its decision-making process.

- `@article` [Everything You Need To Master Actor Critic Methods | Tensorflow 2 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LawaN3BdI00)

#### ROC-AUC

ROC-AUC, or Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve, is a performance measurement for classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve that plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at different threshold values. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve from (0,0) to (1,1). AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds.

- `@article` [Classification: ROC and AUC](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc)

#### Log Loss

Log Loss, also known as cross-entropy loss, quantifies the performance of a classification model where the prediction input is a probability value between 0 and 1. It measures the uncertainty of the model's predicted probabilities compared to the actual labels. Lower Log Loss values indicate better calibrated predictions, meaning the predicted probabilities align more closely with the true outcomes.

### Metrics to Evaluate

Model evaluation metrics are quantitative measures used to assess the performance of a machine learning model. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is generalizing to unseen data and help in comparing different models or tuning hyperparameters. They quantify various aspects of model behavior, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and error rate, allowing data scientists to make informed decisions about model selection and deployment.

- `@article` [Metrics and scoring: quantifying the quality of predictions | scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)

### Validation Techniques

Validation techniques are methods used to estimate how well a machine learning model will generalize to unseen data. They involve splitting the available data into different subsets: a training set used to train the model, and a validation set used to evaluate the model's performance during training or hyperparameter tuning. By assessing the model on data it hasn't seen before, validation techniques help to identify issues like overfitting and underfitting, and ultimately guide the selection of the best model for a given task.

#### LOOCV

Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) is a specific type of cross-validation where each single data point in the dataset is used as the test set, while the remaining data points form the training set. This process is repeated for every data point, resulting in as many models being trained and evaluated as there are data points in the original dataset. The final performance metric is then calculated by averaging the performance across all these individual evaluations.

#### Padding

Padding, in the context of convolutional neural networks, refers to adding extra layers of "pixels" or values around the input image or feature map. This is typically done with zeros (zero-padding), but other values can be used. The primary purpose of padding is to control the spatial size of the output feature maps and to manage boundary effects that arise during convolution operations. By strategically adding padding, we can preserve the original input size, prevent information loss at the edges, and improve the performance of the network.

### Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to process sequential data, where the order of the inputs matters. Unlike traditional feedforward networks that treat each input independently, RNNs have a "memory" that allows them to consider previous inputs when processing new ones. This memory is implemented through recurrent connections, which feed the output of a neuron back into itself or other neurons in the network, enabling the network to learn patterns and dependencies across time or sequence steps.

### Applications of CNNs

CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision, leading to significant advancements in many real-world applications. Thanks to their power to solve complex problems like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition, CNNs power many applications we use daily, like automatically tagging friends in photos, enabling self-driving cars to "see" and understand their surroundings, and helping doctors diagnose diseases from medical scans. They are also used to generate realistic images, translate languages, and even create art.

#### RNN

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to process sequential data. Unlike standard feedforward networks that treat each input independently, RNNs have connections that loop back on themselves, allowing them to maintain a "memory" of past inputs. This memory enables them to learn patterns and dependencies across sequences, making them suitable for tasks like natural language processing, time series analysis, and speech recognition.

#### GRU

A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. It's designed to handle the vanishing gradient problem often encountered when training standard RNNs, especially with long sequences of data. GRUs use "gates" to control the flow of information, deciding what information to keep and what to discard at each time step. These gates are learned during training and allow the network to selectively remember or forget previous states, making it more effective at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data.

#### LSTM

LSTMs are a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to handle the vanishing gradient problem that often occurs when training standard RNNs. They excel at processing sequential data by maintaining a "memory" of past inputs, allowing them to learn long-term dependencies. This memory is controlled by gates that regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell state, enabling LSTMs to selectively remember or forget information over time.

#### Image Classification

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image classification tasks. They work by automatically learning relevant features from images through convolutional layers, which detect patterns like edges and textures. These learned features are then used to classify the image into different categories, such as identifying objects like cats, dogs, or cars. CNNs excel at this because they can handle the high dimensionality of image data and are robust to variations in object position, scale, and lighting.

### Attention Mechanisms

Developed by Google researchers, the attention mechanisms allow a neural network to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data when making predictions. Instead of processing the entire input uniformly, attention mechanisms assign weights to different parts of the input, indicating their importance. These weights are then used to create a weighted average of the input, which is used for further processing. This allows the model to selectively attend to the most informative parts of the input, improving performance, especially in tasks involving sequential data like text or images.

#### Image Segmentation

Image segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple regions or segments, often to identify objects or boundaries. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for this task. They learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, enabling pixel-wise classification. This means each pixel is assigned a label indicating which segment it belongs to. For example, in a self-driving car, CNNs can segment images to identify roads, pedestrians, and other vehicles, allowing the car to "understand" its surroundings. Other applications include medical image analysis for tumor detection and satellite imagery analysis for land cover classification.

#### Transformers

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that rely on attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process data sequentially, transformers can process the entire input at once, allowing for parallelization and capturing long-range dependencies more effectively. This architecture is particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as natural language processing, where understanding the context of words within a sentence is crucial.

#### Multi-head Attention

Multi-head attention is an attention mechanism that runs through the attention process multiple times independently. Each of these independent attention mechanisms is called a "head." The outputs of all the heads are then concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output. This allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence with different learned representations, capturing a richer set of relationships than a single attention mechanism could.

### Autoencoders

Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. They work by compressing the input data into a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and then reconstructing the original input from this compressed representation (decoding). The network is trained to minimize the difference between the original input and the reconstructed output, forcing it to learn efficient and meaningful representations of the data.

### Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of neural network architecture designed to generate new data that resembles the data they were trained on. They consist of two networks: a generator, which creates new data instances, and a discriminator, which evaluates the authenticity of the generated data. These two networks are trained in an adversarial process, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data. This competition drives both networks to improve, ultimately leading the generator to produce highly realistic data.

### Explainable AI

Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on making machine learning models and their decisions understandable to humans. Instead of treating models as black boxes, XAI aims to provide insights into how a model arrives at a particular prediction or decision. This involves developing techniques that allow us to interpret the model's internal logic, identify the factors that influence its outputs, and assess its reliability and potential biases.

### Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding by developing algorithms and models that can process and analyze text and speech data. This allows machines to perform tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.

#### Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text string into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements. The goal is to convert raw text into a format that can be easily processed and analyzed by a computer.

#### Lemmatization

Lemmatization is a text normalization technique in natural language processing used to reduce words to their dictionary form, known as a lemma. Unlike stemming, which simply chops off prefixes or suffixes, lemmatization considers the context of the word and applies morphological analysis to find the base or dictionary form. This ensures that the resulting lemma is a valid word, providing a more accurate and meaningful representation of the original word.
